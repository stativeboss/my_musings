So I play it often (sometimes even mindlessly). You can find my chess.com page here     - Before starting this blog, I never got to study chess formally. Now I plan to spend some time studying chess and documenting my learnings.     - I felt it'd be great if I could document my learnings in a blog, and that's why this vertical. * Verification     - I am a front end Design Verification engineer and Verification is my bread and butter.     - The domain is ever expanding (so many protocols, so many methodologies, so many perspectives {VIP, SoC, IP etc.,}) and there's humungous scope for improvement.     - I remember learning about corner cases in FIFO a couple of years back which I don't remember now. If only I had my short notes available, I'd have quickly gave it a glance. Why don't I digitalize my short notes? In fact, why don't I blog my notes? * Philosophy     - I keep exploring the three major schools of thought that our ancients passed on to us:       - Dvaita       - Advaita (I find major connection to this wisdom)       - Visistadvaita     - I also sometimes read articles or books on life in general.     - I plan to document those learnings under the heading 'Vichaara Saagaram'.     - A bit about the title:         - Vichaaram means contemplation or Inquiry.         - Saagaram means Ocean.         - Vichaara Saagaram means an Ocean of Contemplation.</p> <p>I hope you find this blog interesting and informative.</p> <p>Side Note: In case you are curious about the picture I used on this page, it's a caveman sharing his learnings with all of us with the stone being his blog.</p>"},{"location":"blog/","title":"Blog","text":""},{"location":"blog/2024/01/31/hello-world/","title":"Hello world!","text":"<p>Most popular phrase used when trying out new stuff :P</p>"},{"location":"blog/2024/09/22/chess-chronicles/","title":"Chess Chronicles","text":""},{"location":"blog/2024/09/22/chess-chronicles/#at-the-end-of-the-game-the-king-and-the-pawn-go-back-in-the-same-box","title":"\u201cAt the end of the game, the king and the pawn go back in the same box\u201d","text":"<ul> <li>My Games</li> <li>Pro Games Study</li> <li>Openings Repertoires</li> <li>Middle Game Strategies</li> <li>Endgame Techniques</li> <li>Tactics and Motifs</li> </ul>"},{"location":"blog/2024/09/22/end-game-techniques/","title":"End Game Techniques","text":""},{"location":"blog/2024/09/22/middle-game-strategies/","title":"Middle Game Strategies","text":""},{"location":"blog/2024/09/22/my-first-chess-game-doc/","title":"My first chess game doc","text":""},{"location":"blog/2024/09/22/my-first-chess-game-doc/#my-first-game-analysis","title":"My First Game Analysis","text":"<p>Here's the PGN of a game I played recently:</p> <p></p> <p>The above image is created using gfychess.com</p> <p>It doesn't have notations.
