You can find my chess.com page here. Before starting this blog, I never got to study chess formally. Now I plan to spend some time studying chess and documenting my learnings. I felt it'd be great if I could document my learnings in a blog, and that's why this vertical.</p> </li> <li> <p>Verification</p> <p>As a front-end Design Verification engineer, verification is what I do daily. The field is vast, with numerous protocols, methodologies, and perspectives (VIP, SoC, IP, etc.), offering endless opportunities for growth. I recall learning about FIFO corner cases a few years ago, but now I struggle to remember the details. If I had my notes handy, I could refresh my memory quickly. So, I thought why not digitize and blog all that I learn?</p> </li> <li> <p>Philosophy</p> <p>I enjoy exploring ancient schools of thought like Dvaita, Advaita (which resonates with me most), and Visistadvaita. Occasionally, I also read articles and books about life in general. I'll be documenting these reflections under a section called Vichaara Saagaram. \"Vichaaram\" means contemplation or inquiry, and \"Saagaram\" means ocean. Together, Vichaara Saagaram represents an ocean of contemplation.</p> </li> </ul> <p>I hope you find this blog interesting and informative.
